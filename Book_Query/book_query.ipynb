Chief Justice of the Supreme Court José María\\nIglesias refused to ratify the results and declared against the government as\\nwell, delivering a fatal blow to the incumbent, who until then had\\nsuccessfully kept the rebellion at bay . W ith Lerdo on his way into exile,\\nDíaz sought a deal with Iglesias, president by constitutional order of\\nsuccession. When he refused to cooperate, Díaz made short work of his\\nrapidly dissolving army . Ever respectful of democratic conventions, Díaz\\nwas formally elected president in 1877.\\nIf many Mexicans welcomed the onset of peace, Díaz’ s political\\nopponents did their best to undermine it. A series of uprisings by Lerdo\\nsupporters over the course of his first four -year term, several launched from\\nthe relative safety of the U.S. border , were easily and often brutally\\nsuppressed either by Díaz’ s army or by the forces of powerful allies like the\\nNuevo León cacique  (strongman) Jerónimo T reviño. Disgruntled generals,\\nsome displeased with the division of spoils, others resistant to the growing\\npower of the Porfirian state apparatus, met a similar fate. So did less\\nprominent opponents, whether dispossessed campesinos  (peasants) or\\nalienated pur o  (radical) liberals. When asked by V eracruz governor Luis\\nMier y T erán to decide the fate of nine local businessmen accused of\\nsedition, Díaz reputedly telegraphed back, “Kill them at once.” T rue or not,\\nthis often-repeated anecdote demonstrated the president’ s resolve to his\\npotential opponents. It also highlighted the benefits of a rapidly growing\\ninfrastructure of telegraph lines, highways, and railroads that considerably\\nimproved the regime’ s ability to deal with internal threats to public order .'),\n",

In Porfirian Mexico, the slogans revealed a fundamental\\ncontradiction. There the commitment to order meant less violence perhaps\\nand more administration certainly , but it also meant more politics (and more\\npersonalized politics), rather than less. In fact, Díaz’ s remarkable ability to\\nmanipulate the traditional social relations of patronage, clientage, and even\\ngodparentage was the keystone in the arch of order . W ithout politics, and\\ntraditional politics at that, the regime stood little chance of success. So the\\nIndispensable Caudillo proceeded to play politics with a vengeance.\\nT o the intelligentsia, Porfirio Díaz was the quintessential Mexican\\npolitician. Sociologist Andrés Molina Enríquez, for example, remarked on\\n“the mutual comprehension and confidence” that Díaz shared even with\\nignorant indios , a trait he ascribed to the general’ s mestizo heritage.\\n“Physically and morally ,” he concluded, “General Díaz [is] a wonderful\\nexample of the national mestizo racial type that has begun to be, and plainly\\nwill be in the future, the true national type.” For francophiles like novelist\\nFederico Gamboa, his very Mexicanness made Díaz something of an\\nenigma. After years of observation, the era’ s foremost chronicler of the\\nhuman condition could only conclude that “he is the Sphinx, even by his\\ncolor and by his origin, he is the Sphinx!”\\nMore analytical than most (although just as condescending), Justo Sierra\\ncommented on Díaz’ s “inverted” mental pattern in which “deliberation\\nfollows the act of will . . . and modifies or even nullifies the original\\ndecision.” This typically mestizo mental pattern, Sierra added, “has given\\nrise to imputations of political perfidy (deceiving in order to persuade,\\ndividing in order to rule)” even if these traditional political vices are'),\n",

Four López Mateos cabinet of ficers served under him, while\\nthe novelist Agustín Yáñez oversaw a Ministry of Education that still\\nreceived a disproportionate share of the federal budget. It is true that Díaz\\nOrdaz curtailed agrarian reform, but this appears to have been more the\\nresult of a shortage of distributable land than an ideological objective. As he\\ninsinuated he would in his inauguration speech, he preserved formal\\nrelations with Fidel Castro’ s Cuba, to the chagrin of the United States, and\\nhis Ministry of Foreign Af fairs spearheaded a drive to make Latin America\\na nuclear -free zone.\\nDíaz Ordaz, then, was not an unusual president out of step with Mexico’ s\\npolitical establishment. Y et his term in of fice, marred by a series of events\\ndestined to vilify him, was atypical. The paranoia of the powerful elites he\\nrepresented collided with the aspirations of idealistic middle-class\\nteenagers.\\nThe origins of the crisis were amazingly simple. In July 1968, after\\nmonths of mindless juvenile petty crime driven by gang allegiances and\\ninterschool rivalries, Mexico City’ s crack riot police badly overreacted to a\\nstreet melee between competing students from two downtown preparatory\\nschools. The Granaderos, as these troops were called, had had a long history\\nof abusive treatment of civilians since their founding under Alemán in\\n1949. After roughing up multiple teens and bystanders, the Granaderos\\nthemselves became a cause of protest, upon which, perhaps to the surprise\\nof everyone, tens of thousands of angry citizens took to the streets.
